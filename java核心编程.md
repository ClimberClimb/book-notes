# Java核心编程
## 第一章
* Simple
	* The syntax for java is a simple version of C++.
	* There is no need for header files, pointer arithmetic, structures, unions, operator overloading, virtual base classes.
	* There is now a separate Java Micro Edition with a smaller library, suitable for embedded device
* Object-Oriented
	* Object-oriented design is a programming language technique that focuses on the data and on the interfaces to that object
* Distributed 
* Robust
	* The jave compiler detects many problems that in other languages would  show up only at runtime
* Secure 
	* Java was designed to make certain kinds of attacks impossible among them
		* Overruning the runtime stack
		* Corrupting memory outside its own process space
		* Reading or writing files without permission
* Architecture-Neutral
	* Virtual machines have the option of translating the most frequently executed bytecode sequences into machine code-a process called just-in-time compilation
* Portable
	* The java librarie do a great job of letting you work in. a platform-independent manner
* Interpreted
* High-Performance
* Multithreaded
* Dynamic
	* Libraries can freely add new methods and instance variables without any effect on their clients
